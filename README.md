# Position control and halogen intensity for Auto
this document  consists implementing a digital PID controller using Labview software to control a DC motor. Arduino allows to control the intensity of the Halogens, initially given a brief description of the drivers, then proceed to find the equation of the plant, PID controller design, implementation and verification of the results.
